.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBJuggler\fP is a basic UDP load-balancer that listens on whichever ports are specified and round-robins UDP packets to the specified
target ports.  Without a target port, \fBjuggler\fP writes to stdout.  It is written in threaded C, with one thread per listening port.
.PP
The options are:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
print help
.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fI<size>\fR
set maximum packet size - default is 16384
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fI<level>\fR
set log level (error, warn, notice, info or debug) - default is notice
.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fI<port>\fR
listen on specified UDP port for packets (option can repeat)
.TP
\fB\-t\fR \fI[<host>:]<port>\fR
send to host:port (host defaults to localhost) (option can repeat)
.SH BEHAVIOUR
\fBJuggler\fP is a simple soul.  It performs no health checks (very difficult anyway with UDP).  It receives packets and just round-robins
them to the configured targets.  It does no checking on the contents, or the senders.  It logs problems to stdout.
.PP
If you need something more complex, you probably want nginx.
